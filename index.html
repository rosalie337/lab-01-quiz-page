            <p>
                Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground was where I spent most of my days.
                Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood.
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
            </p>
            <p>
                I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought, "Nah, forget it"
                â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air!". I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie "Yo homes smell ya later!" I looked at my kingdom
                I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air!
